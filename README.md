# Aruspecs
### Aruspecs is the financial records oracle of Aabode, a private residential real estate financing solution for the homebuyers of the future.

Aruspecs is the Phase One development of Aabode, an end-to-end suite of mortgage origination, investing, and real estate transaction tools built to serve the housing market of the future. 

Aabode’s objective is to streamline today’s homebuying supply chain by leveraging Algorand’s decentralized, secure, and scalable network. Aruspecs will connect Plaid’s data transfer network to Aabode’s mortgage origination and servicing stateful smart contracts on Algorand.

Plaid is an off-chain financial services intermediary that uses a single unified bank API to facilitate encrypted communication between financial institutions.
Plaid already supports a sizable financial infrastructure connecting over 11,500 institutions across North America and Europe today.

Data transferred from Plaid will provide us with at least 70% of information needed to underwrite a typical loan.

To build Aruspecs as part of Algorand’s ecosystem means any of the network’s DeFi or payment solutions will be able to conduct KYC, access user-permitted information such as cash flow, sources of income, and banking credentials to create decentralized digital identity and privacy preserving Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) from centralized legacy data.
